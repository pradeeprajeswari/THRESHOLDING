# THRESHOLDING
# Aim
To segment the image using global thresholding, adaptive thresholding and Otsu's thresholding using python and OpenCV.

# Software Required
Anaconda - Python 3.7
OpenCV
# Algorithm
## Step1:

Load the necessary packages.
## Step2:

Read the Image and convert to grayscale.
## Step3:

Use Global thresholding to segment the image.
## Step4:

Use Adaptive thresholding to segment the image.
## Step5:

Use Otsu's method to segment the image and display the results.
# Program
# Load the necessary packages





# Read the Image and convert to grayscale




# Use Global thresholding to segment the image




# Use Adaptive thresholding to segment the image




# Use Otsu's method to segment the image 




# Display the results



# Output
Original Image





Global Thresholding





Adaptive Thresholding





Optimum Global Thesholding using Otsu's Method





# Result
Thus the images are segmented using global thresholding, adaptive thresholding and optimum global thresholding using python and OpenCV.
